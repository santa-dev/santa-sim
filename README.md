# santa-sim

SANTA is JAVA software application that simulates the evolution of a population of gene sequences
forwards through time. It models the underlying biological processes
as discrete components; replication (including recombination),
mutation (including indels), fitness and selection. SANTA is easy to use and is well-suited to simulate pathogen evolution according to different scenarios. 

A pre-built cross-platform executable jar file (`santa.jar`) for SANTA-SIM v1.0 is available at the [Releases page](https://github.com/santa-dev/santa-sim/releases).


To download and build the project from source code, please execute the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/santa-dev/santa-sim
ant
```

Detailed information on how to use SANTA is available at the [wiki](https://github.com/santa-dev/santa-sim/wiki) page.  Several example simulation configuration files (.xml) are inside the _examples_ directory.
